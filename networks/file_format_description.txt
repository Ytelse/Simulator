First line is the number n. It specifies how many layers there are in the network. That is the number of matrices and vectors.
If the first line is 4, it means that there will come 4 matrices and 4 bias vectors in the input.

Then there will come n pairs of matrices and vectors. First a matrix and then a vector
The matrix starts with two lines. The first line is matrix width and the second is matrix height.
The next (matrix width) * (matrix height) lines is each element in the matrix, written row wise.

After each matrix, the bias vector is written. The first line of the vector is the size of the vector.
The next (vector size) lines are each element in the vector.

After the vector is the next matrix.
